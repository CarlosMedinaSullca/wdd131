            <h2>Helaman 8:14-16</h2>
            <p>14 Yea, did he not bear record that the Son of God should come? And as he lifted up the brazen serpent in the wilderness, even so shall he be lifted up who should come.

                15 And as many as should look upon that serpent should live, even so as many as should look upon the Son of God with faith, having a contrite spirit, might live, even unto that life which is eternal.
                
                16 And now behold, Moses did not only testify of these things, but also all the holy prophets, from his days even to the days of Abraham.</p>

            <h2>Helaman 6:35-36</h2>
            <p>35 And thus we see that the Spirit of the Lord began to withdraw from the Nephites, because of the wickedness and the hardness of their hearts.

                36 And thus we see that the Lord began to pour out his Spirit upon the Lamanites, because of their easiness and willingness to believe in his words.</p>
